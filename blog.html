            For now, I will not make buttons that create a link with other website, or other pages talking about my incredible skills on HTLM. <br>
            But in a near futur I hope I will know how to do it.<br>

            <h3> What is ecology ? And why it is important to preserve our environment ? </h5>
            <p> <b> <span class = "ecology"> Ecology </span></b> is the study of interactions among living things and their environment. It provides new understanding of these vital systems as they are now, and how they may change in the future.
            <b> <span class = "ecology">Ecology </span></b>enriches our world and is crucial for human wellbeing and prosperity. It provides new knowledge of the interdependence between people and nature that is vital for food production, maintaining 
            clean air and water, and sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate. In the 1960s, ecological research identified two of the major causes of poor water quality in lakes and streams-phosphorous 
            and nitrogen-which were found in large amounts in laundry detergents and fertilizers. Provided with this information, citizens were able to take the necessary steps to help restore their communities’ 
            lakes and streams-many of which are once again popular for fishing and swimming.</p>
        </div>
        
            <p>An aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem found in and around a body of water, in contrast to land-based terrestrial ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems contain communities of organisms—aquatic life—that are dependent on each other and on their 
            environment. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems. Freshwater ecosystems may be lentic (slow moving water, including pools, ponds, and lakes); lotic (faster moving water, for example 
            streams and rivers); and wetlands (areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time)</p>
